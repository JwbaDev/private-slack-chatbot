Page Title: Recognition Program - CodiStars Content: The CodiStars awards program are awards from you for you - for people who stand out in the company in a special way. Thanks to it, you can appreciate people who actively represent the activities and thus deserve an award. Your voice has power, so we encourage you to get involved. Remember that the CodiStars program is for employees and associates only, therefore you cannot award titles to people who are no longer working at CodiLime. The awards are given in 3 categories that relate directly to our values: Team Up To Win - Team Player Disrupt category is Grow - Improver Act to Deliver category - Do-er category Below you will find a detailed description of each category: Team Player - a distinction for a person whose actions have positively influenced contacts between employees and the mood in teams. It can be organizing integration, helping a teammate, or engaging in additional activities such as volunteering. Improver - a distinction for a person whose actions improve internal processes in the company and the team. He often proposes various solutions to improve teamwork and the company itself. He can fix things in the project that don't work, or organize channels on slack. Do-er - a distinction for a person who delivers. He is someone who performs the tasks entrusted to him well and can save many fires in the project. He participates in the preparation of bottles, tech talks and webinars. He willingly shares his knowledge with others. This year, we are also changing the formula for submitting applications to make it easier for you to participate in the whole process. The formula was developed by the HR department together with the DDoS group. Candidates for individual categories can be submitted using a specially prepared bot on Slack. How the bot works: To vote for a given person, start VoteBot by entering /vote in the message field on Slack and press ENTER. A form to complete will appear in the window. Select the person you want to nominate from the drop-down list, then assign them value points. You must distribute all 3 points! Each person can vote for any number of CodiLime employees within one month. You cannot vote twice for one and the same person within one month. Casting a second vote for the same person will be tantamount to deleting the previous vote. For a vote we understand the distribution of 3 points. When voting, it is necessary to distribute all 3 points. Points can be distributed evenly between all three categories, or more of a specific value. Example: all 3 points on Disrupt To Grow or 2 on Team up to win and 1 on Act to Deliver. It is not possible to transfer points to yourself. After a month, you can vote again for the person you voted for earlier. To check who you voted for, you can use the /check-votes command. In the window you will see a list of who and in what amounts you have awarded points. To check how many votes you have received so far, you can use the /check-points command. The window will show you how many points you have received, but you will not see who voted for you. If you need a reminder about the rules of the competition, you can use the /about command, which will remind you of the most important rules of the Recognition Program. The first prize distribution in this formula will take place at the communication meeting in January 2023. Points received from October 2022 to the end of December 2022 will be taken into account. One person can win only in one category - if he receives the most points in two or three categories only wins the one with the most points. In the event of a tie, more than one person may receive the prize. In a situation where no entries are received in one of the categories, it will not be taken into account during the award ceremony. In unusual situations, the HR department together with the DDoS group will be decisive.

Page Title: Webinars - the how-to for speakers Content: If you’re here, first of all, huge thanks for your engagement in this challenging project. Here you can find some information about what it means to be a webinar speaker and what you should expect. As a marketing team, we will support and guide you at every stage of this project. Stage 1 - Brief: You’ll take part in the preparation of a document (like this one: AI/ML for networks - webinar brief), which gives an overview of a planned webinar. During this stage, you should bear in mind your audience - we’re targeting mostly technical managers/CEOs who make decisions about future cooperation. Don’t forget to plan the presentation, including the agenda and speaking order. A completed brief is also a crucial part of planning and preparation for a whole bunch of marketing materials and activities, which is why it has to be finished in advance (at least 7-8 weeks before the planned webinar date). Stage 2 - Planning At this stage, we’ll be in touch to align: Date of webinar. Date of dry-run in the recording room. Time for presentation preparation. Time for presentation UX check. Logistics details (all webinars are recorded in our Warsaw office, so even if you work remotely, we will meet in person on webinar day). Stage 3 - Promotion Among many marketing activities planned around the webinar, we’ll invite you only for recording YT shorts/Reels videos. The short we want to record will be a short announcement/invitation to the webinar, so the recording will not last longer than 15-20 seconds. During the recording, you briefly introduce yourself, then invite people to the webinar, and in 1-2 sentences you talk about what it will be about. Usually, there are two speakers on the recording, therefore we suggest sharing some issues, e.g.: Speaker 1: hello + introduction Speaker 2: introduction + invitation to participate in the webinar Speaker 1: 1-2 sentences about what you will show during the webinar Speaker 2: why you should join + ending We aim for brevity and we want it to come out naturally, so learning lines by heart is out of the question, we prefer you to say it in your own words. As for dress code, there are no major restrictions, we only ask you not to wear flashy colours or clothes with a busy pattern; if it is possible, you’ll get CodiLime t-shirts. Stage 4 - Dry run and the day zero On the previously agreed dates, we’ll meet at CodiLime’s Warsaw office in the recording room (2nd floor, room 2-P-4). You can arrange as many dry runs as you need, but we need at least one conducted in the recording room - it will help you to feel more comfortable during the main recording session. On the day of the webinar, we will meet two hours before the event starts to do a final dry run, and after that the main recording.  If you have received your CodiLime t-shirt, bring it with you. Usually, there are some questions from the audience after the session, they leave them in the chat window, you’ll see them live.  Stage 5 - After the webinar If any code appeared during the webinar preparation, please add it to CodiLime’s GitHub, according to these instructions: Webinars & video repo - template You’ll be asked to review the recording subtitles (Ola Lizner from the content team will contact you about this).

Page Title: Yosemite Content: ADDRESS: Yosemite Valley, CA 95389 WEBSITE: https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm Yosemite National Park is one of the most visited places by Codi Travelers. It is located about 4 hours drive from Silicon Valley, so for a trip worth a weekend trip. In the valley it is possible to stay overnight (after booking a place at a campsite or in hostels in advance), or you can look for hotels outside the valley if you do not get a place. visit the alert page: https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htmyou mustn't leave any food or toiletries in the car after dark!!! bears living in the area have a very good sense of smell and are able to detect smells - they can destroy the car when they try to get insideexamples of photos: http://i.imgur.com/Nmg9IHY.jpg, http://bearsmartdurango.org/wp -content/uploads/2013/07/truck_bear-trapped-inside-4.jpg anti-bear lockers are available in several places (it is worth having a padlock with you so that no one else can get into them as well) all garbage should be thrown into special garbage containers it is forbidden to touch any animalsrodents can carry plague and other diseasesrodents can come very close, so it is worth watching out for them on long weekends they are usually crowdedit is better not to pitch tents in the wild, outside of designated places, unless the rangers allow it traffic in the valley (vehicle and pedestrian) can be regulated by the rangers, in the case of hiking with overnight stays in tents, special anti-bear packaging for food/cosmetics, etc. should be taken from the rangers. The packaging is stored outside the tents, because bears smell the inside anywayif there are anti-bear lockers in the area, let's use them some trips require additional permits (information will be found later in the guide) the price of gasoline in the Yosemite area is usually higher than in the CodiDomek area (in May 2018 the difference was over $ 1 per gallon) it is worth buying food in advance at the Rei supermarket or sports store, e.g. granola bar, canned food (if you like lunch, i.e. spam), nuts, beef jerky, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, cherry tomatoes, pre-packaged meat, salami, etc. drinking water, preferably water/isotonic sunscreen/cover heads/sunglassesthere are gift shops in the valley and at Glacier Point (T-shirts, mugs, postcards, magnets, etc.) There is little or no signal coverage for phones in Yosemite - it's a good idea to switch your phone to airplane mode so you don't lose the batteries at the entrance to the park give maps, they are quite inaccurate - it is worth getting a better one at the Visitor Center or printing it out in advance from the Internet picnic area) during the season when snow may fall, some roads may be closed or only accessible with snow chains access roads may be winding, it is worth having something for motion sickness Yosemite Valley Upper Falls present in April 2019). The trail to the top is about 3.5 miles one way. The first part of the ascent is a rocky staircase. After about 1 mile you reach the Columbia Rock viewpoint, after which the road descends for some time. After another 0.5 mile, you reach the waterfall view. The conditions on the trail are very dependent on the season (in April 2019 the upper half of the trail was covered with snow).TunnelviewGlacier PointSentinel DomeFour Mile TrailCloudsrestHalf Dome

InfoSec proceeds with resolving the ticket: conducts an assessment of the event, resolves events based on the assessment performed. InfoSec closes the ticket after it is resolved. InfoSec uses data from events to improve ISMS. Evidence All event information and attachments may be considered as evidence and are collected at http://help.codilime.com or, if necessary, on an InfoSec shared drive. Access to this data is restricted to authorized persons and may not be deleted without permission from the Head of InfoSec.

Page Title: Maple Content: Description: The project is about the orchestration of virtual firewalls. Technologies: Python, PyTest, Playwright, FastAPI, Pydantic, Git, Keysight, Fortitester, AngularExternal name: MapleProject Manager: Project Technical Leader: (QA) (Dev) (Net)BizDev Goals:BizDev GoalPSsmartNICSDNWAN contr.SD-WAN/LANMonitoringTestsNFV platformSecurity
Business goal The main goal of this project is to help our client to turn PoC into an MVP ready product. Current situation on the market (overview):Currently, firewall vendors provide very capable virtual firewalls that are closely modeled after their traditional hardware offerings. There are multiple models offered that allow for increasing capacity with respect to inspection capability (through-put, connection rate and total connections).Today's firewalls offer many services and they can support many network topologies. They are frequently deployed on L2 mode or as L3 devices.Vendors also provide management tools for defining and maintaining policy and configuration details across multiple firewall instances that might exist in a given customer network.The key to the success is to define the gap to be filled by innovative solution. So, two main problems were defined and are listed below:A gap in the firewall vendor's offerings are solutions to assist customers in the orchestration of the virtual firewalls - they expect their customers to deal with installation, licensing and then connecting to the management tool suite . As such there are certain expectations when it comes to the technical capabilities of the firewall customer. They must be technical enough to get the firewalls running - or they must be willing to pay professional services for installation - and then maintenance on their deployed instance.As the number of firewalls scale - such as what one would expect at a managed service provider - the requirements of the firewall customer grow exponentially as they must now maintain tens or hundreds of instances. They have no choice but to have their own dev-ops teams.Our client vision:The vision is to provide a security VM orchestrator that fully understands how to deploy and maintain virtual firewalls - autonomously handling all the required steps to prep a server, install the OS and hypervisor, run the desired VM/Firewall and handle the licensing in preparation for connecting with the management suite and then providing the actual network connectivity and protection. Simplified diagram which describes a big picture of the developed solution:Client typeA company provided many network solutions and services for cybersecurity. The leader in scaling network security (turnkey network security virtualization platforms, scalable network solutions)Our approachNetworking knowledge and strong experience in Quality Assurance and solutions development are additional value in our work. Onboarding takes very few time for CodiLime teams due to understanding industry matters. Moreover, in every project we try to understand the client’s needs deeply what is the key to success.
