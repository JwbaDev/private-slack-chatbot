To check who you voted for, you can use the /check-votes command. In the window you will see a list of who and in what amounts you have awarded points. To check how many votes you have received so far, you can use the /check-points command. The window will show you how many points you have received, but you will not see who voted for you. If you need a reminder about the rules of the competition, you can use the /about command, which will remind you of the most important rules of the Recognition Program. The first prize distribution in this formula will take place at the communication meeting in January 2023. Points received from October 2022 to the end of December 2022 will be taken into account. One person can win only in one category - if he receives the most points in two or three categories only wins the one with the most points. In the event of a tie, more than one person may receive the prize. In a situation where no entries are received in one of the categories, it will not be taken into account during the award ceremony. In unusual situations, the HR department together with the DDoS group will be decisive.
